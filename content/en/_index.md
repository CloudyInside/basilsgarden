## Welcome!

Hi there! Basil here, and this is my little space on the internet. Here you will be able to find a collection of favourite art of my own, links to my socials and my own blog.

My pronouns are {{< accent >}}she/her{{< /accent >}} or {{< accent >}}they/them{{< /accent >}}.

I am webdev student from {{< accent >}}Andalucía, Spain{{< /accent >}} who likes too many things, say photography, games, drawing and computers, and who knows what else. See the relevant section for more.

If you are here because I met you in a con or scanned my card's QR code and you took a pic with me, you can tag me in my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cloudylnside/).
